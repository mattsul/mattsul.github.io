            <h2>PCB Design</h2>
            <p>
              During my time at UW, I heard many complains from my classmates
              about the lack of PCB design courses at UW. During my senior year,
              we had an town hall meeting to address electrical engineering
              courses. During this meeting, many students revealed their
              discontent with the lack of PCB design courses. EE 201 - Computer
              Hardware Skills was produced as a result.
            </p>
            <p>
              I find it neccessary to learn and print PCBs. I have experience
              designign and etching circuit boards by hand, and I was excited to
              finally print and populate a real PCB.
            </p>
            <p>
              I could not imagine a better PCB practice circuit than my EE 233
              project - a 3-way audio mixer. The schematic, completed in class,
              is shown below.
            </p>
            \
            <img
              src="images/AudioSchematic.png"
              alt="3-Channel Audio Mixer Schematic"
            />
            <p>
              From the schematic, I laid the componenets out as close together
              as I could comfortably while minimizing overlapping lines. I read
              online that it is best to have ICs centered and passive components
              closest to the edge. Because I am using many potentiometers as
              tuners, I thought it would be best to keep those closest to the
              edge to help explain how to use the system. The left-most turners
              are volume controllers for each of the three inputs and the
              resulting mixture. The right most tuners adjust the volume of the
              low, middle, and high frequencies.

              Routing was an interesting experience that took a few tries. I
              started with the AutoRouter, and -- while it 'worked' -- it was
              not ideal. I started over and manually routed the ICs and
              potentiometers before AutoRouting the passive components.

              I am adding a bottom silk layer that says my name and the
              project's name. And with that, they are off to printing!

            <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
            <p>
              I enrolled in EE 474 - Embedded Systems during the Summer 2020
              pandemic in addition to Introduction to Machine Learning and Data
              Structures and Algorithms. I also started my job at Subway.
              Unfortunately, the course was too much for me, and I dropped it,
              thinking my capstone would be an in-person, embedded focused
              project in Spring 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, things did not turn out that way, and I am going
              back to relearn the material! Fortunately, there are many
              tutorials and resources available to learn embedded systems! I
              will be following a tutorial by
              <a

                >Mr. Dr. Prof. Bolt</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bolt blogs his process in designing a top-down shooter for a
              business card. I will be designing a business card to show in
              interviews, however, I prefer to implement Pong. I will describe
              my processes, code, and concepts to help those who might not
              understand Bolt's explanations.

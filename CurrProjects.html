					<h2>PCB Design</h2>
					<p>During my time at UW, I heard many complains from my classmates about the lack of PCB design
						courses at UW. During my senior year, we had an town hall meeting to address electrical
						engineering courses. During this meeting, many students revealed their discontent with the lack
						of PCB design courses. EE 201 - Computer Hardware Skills was produced as a result.</p>
					<p>I find it neccessary to learn and print PCBs. I have experience designign and etching circuit
						boards by hand, and I was excited to finally print and populate a real PCB. </p>
					<p>I could not imagine a better PCB practice circuit than my EE 233 project - a 3-way audio mixer.
					</p>
					<img src="images/FirstTraceDesign.png" alt="First Trace Design" />
					<p>This is my first trace design using Eagle CAD. The potentiometers on the left are to adjust the
						volume of the three input songs. The bottom and right potentiometers are for adjusting the
						overall volume and frequency volume (high, medium, low).</p>
					<img src="images/CopperPour.png" alt="Bad Copper Pour" />
					<p>Routing was an interesting experience that took a few tries. I started with the AutoRouter, and
						-- while it 'worked' -- it was not ideal. I started over and manually routed the ICs and
						potentiometers before AutoRouting the passive components.</p>
					<img src="images/BottomSilkLayer.png" alt="Bottom Silk Layer" />
					<p>I am adding a bottom silk layer that says my name, date, and the project's name. And with that,
						they are off to printing!</p>

					<h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
					<p>I enrolled in EE 474 - Embedded Systems during the Summer 2020 pandemic in addition to
						Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Structures and Algorithms. I also started my job at
						Subway. Unfortunately, the course was too much for me, and I dropped it, thinking my capstone
						would be an in-person, embedded focused project in Spring 2021.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, things did not turn out that way, and I am going back to relearn the material!
						Fortunately, there are many tutorials and resources available to learn embedded systems! I will
						be following a tutorial by <a
							href="https://mrdrprofbolt.wordpress.com/2020/11/28/making-an-electronic-business-card-pcb-layout-fabrication-and-assembly/">Mr.
							Dr. Prof. Bolt</a>. </p>
					<p>Bolt blogs his process in designing a top-down shooter for a business card. I will be designing a
						business card to show in interviews, however, I prefer to implement Pong. I will describe my
						processes, code, and concepts to help those who might not understand Bolt's explanations.</p>
